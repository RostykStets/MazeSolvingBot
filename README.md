# Maze solving bot

Variation of Random Mouse Algorithm for solving mazes (presented as two-dimensional array). <br />
Algorithm for generating maze - Deep-First Search Backtracking (DFS Backtracking). <br/> <br />

## Classes:<br />
* Cell - stores row and col coordinates of a cell in maze
* Directions - enum that represents possible directions of move (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)
* Constants - stores symbols for elements of maze like wall, visited cell etc.
* Main - man class with main method (entry point of a program) and rest of the methods (pritMaze, generateMaze, sovleMaze etc.)
